# Hour 7: Program Control
## What You’ll Learn in This Hour:

Using conditional statements
* Comparing values with comparison operators
* Applying logical operators
* Writing loops and control structures
* Setting Timers in JavaScript

In Hour 5, “Numbers and Strings,” and Hour 6, “Arrays,” you took a quick trip
through the data types that JavaScript variables can contain. To create anything
but the simplest scripts, though, you’re going to need your code to make
decisions based on those values. In this hour we examine ways to recognize
particular conditions and have our program act in a prescribed way as a result.
